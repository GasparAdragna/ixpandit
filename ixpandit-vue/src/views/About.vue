        <h1>Gaspar Adragna</h1>
        <p class="mb-1">
          This is my <b>attempt</b> at the challenge that was sent to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think a lot can be improved but for such little timme i focused on
          <b>achieving</b> the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the aspects i think could be <b>done better</b> or
          <b>be improved</b> for another time are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Adding Vuex to store the pokemons or a cookie.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b> Nicer user experience</b>. For such little time, i tried to used
            components from <b>Vuetify</b> to speed the front- end process. More
            colors, a footer and much more could be beneficial for the whole
            user experience
          </li>
          <li>
            Show an image of the Pokemon at the Home page, before clicking on
            Learn More. This would consume a lot more API requests, but it would
            look nice.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Overall i think it was a nice challenge and i hope i was able to
          achieve the goal of the excercise.
        </p>
